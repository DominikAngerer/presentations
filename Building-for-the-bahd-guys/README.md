# Building for the "Bahd" guys

In this talk about security we will address security practices that are often disregarded when building applications. Building with frameworks and other tools often make everyone insensitive to security practices. The talk focuses on making you sensitive to the fact that these holes still exist and can be exploited if care is not taken.
