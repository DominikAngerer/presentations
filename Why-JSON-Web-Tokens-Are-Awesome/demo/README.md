# Why JSON Web Tokens Are Awesome Demo

This repo contains the code shown in the Why JSON Web Tokens are Awesome presentation. To get the project up and running follow these steps:

1. Sign up for an Auth0 account at https://auth0.com/signup
2. Create a New Client and copy its `ClientID`
3. Create a New API and copy its `Audience`
4. Edit the `.env` file with your `Auth0 Tenant Domain` and `Audience`
5. Edit the `auth0-variables.js` file with your `ClientID`, `Audience`, and `Auth0 Tenant Domain`
6. Install Node dependencies by running `npm install`
7. Start the server by running the `npm start` command
8. Ensure that `localhost:5000` is in your list of **Allowed Callback URL's in the Auth0 Dashboard for the Client Created**
9. Ensure that the API you created has a `read:messages` scope added

Your API will run on `localhost:3001`, while your UI will run on `localhost:5000`.

From here you should be able to make any changes in the Auth0 Dashboard and see them reflected in your application when you attempt to login. Happy hacking!

## Auth0 Client Credentials and API Setup

If you haven't already done so, [sign up](https://auth0.com) for your free Auth0 account and create a new client in the [dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com). Find the **domain** and **client ID** from the settings area and add the URL for your application to the **Allowed Callback URLs** box. If you are serving the application with the provided `serve` library, that URL is `http://localhost:5000`.

If you haven't already done so, create a new API in the [APIs section](https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis) and provide an identifier for it.


## Simple Token Example

If you wish to simple authenticate with a self-created JSON Web Token from the `/api/token` route, all you'll have to do is ensure the `/api/nuclear-code` endpoint verifies the signature like this:

```
app.get('/api/nuclear-launch-code', jwt({secret:’super-secret’}), function(req, res){
  res.json({message: 1234})
});
```

This will validate the JSON Web Token against the one generated by clicking the **Get Token** button in the app and will not require the user to login.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).

## Create a free Auth0 account

1. Go to [Auth0](https://auth0.com/signup) and click Sign Up.
2. Use Google, GitHub or Microsoft Account to login.
